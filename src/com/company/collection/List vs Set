                 List                                 Set
1.List is index based Data structure.         1.Set is not an index based Data structure .It stores the data according to the hashcode values.
2.List can store duplicate elements           2.Set does not allow to store duplicate elements.
3.List can store amy number of null values.   3.Set can store only one null value.
4.List follows the insertion order.           4.Set does not follows the insertion order.
5.we can iterate(get) the list elements by    5.we cam iterate the set element by Iterator.
  Iterator and ListIterator


Iterator -> Iterate only forward direction.
ListIterator -> Iterate both (forward and backward ) direction.
